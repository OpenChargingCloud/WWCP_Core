# World Wide Charging Protocol Suite (WWCP) - Core

The World Wide Charging Protocol Suite is a collection of protocols in order to
connect market actors in the field of e-mobility solutions via scalable and secure
Internet protocols. This repository defines the fundamental core concepts, entities
and data structures.

Serveral project make use of this core library:
 - [WWCP Net](https://github.com/GraphDefined/WWCP_Net) is a HTTP interface for WWCP
 - **WWCP Cloud** allows you to run a distributed and fault-tolerant EMP or CPO backend using WWCP, OCPI and the Intercharge protocol.
 - [WWCP OCPI](https://github.com/GraphDefined/WWCP_OCPI) defines a mapping between WWCP and the [Open ChargePoint Interface](https://github.com/ocpi/ocpi).
 - [WWCP OICP](https://github.com/GraphDefined/WWCP_OICP) defines a mapping between WWCP and the Open InterCharge Protocol. Please note, that the Intercharge protocol is not (yet) a free and open protocol and therefore the adapter can not be distributed as free open source software. Nevertheless it is available as shared source for customers of [Hubject GmbH](http://www.hubject.com).

This software is developed by [GraphDefined GmbH](http://www.graphdefined.com).
